Virtual Mouse Using Python
---------------------------
This project implements a virtual mouse using computer vision techniques. 
It allows users to control the mouse pointer and perform various actions 
such as left click, right click, and scrolling without using a physical mouse. 
Instead, it utilizes hand gestures captured through a webcam.

Key Features:
- Tracks hand movements to control the cursor position.
- Detects specific gestures for mouse actions (e.g., clicks, scroll).
- Uses OpenCV for real-time video capture and hand detection.
- Implements MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
